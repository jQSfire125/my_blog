It will be a short update. I just started course 7 of the HarvardX certificate program: Linear Regression.

I believe that all those [DataCamp][datacamp] courses in python have biased my preference. R is a powerful language, and some of the things you can do with a few lines of code are cool. It has taken a while, but I am finally starting to feel I can do actual work with it.

This course is the setup for course eight that focuses on machine learning. I am looking forward to that one. 

After that, it is just the Capstone Project in Course 9, and I will finish the [HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science][harvardXcert]. 

#### Yeah!
