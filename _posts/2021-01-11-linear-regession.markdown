This will be a short update. I just started course 7 of the HarvardX certificate program: Linear Regression.

R is a powerful language, and some of the things you can do with a few lines of code are really cool. It has taken a while, but I am finally starting to feel I can do actual work with it. I believe that all those [Data Camp][datacamp] courses in python have biased my preference.

This course is the setup for course 8 that focuses on machine learning. I am really looking forward to that one. 

After that, it is just the Capstone Project in course 9 and I will be done with the [HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science][harvardXcert]. 

#### Yeah!
