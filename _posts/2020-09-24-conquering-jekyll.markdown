I am delighted to share that I have finally managed to install Jekyll and run the blog on my computer. This morning I decided it was enough, so I took a DataCamp course on shell, and with a little bit of luck, I was able to get past the dreaded `You don't have write permissions` error!

With Jekyll installed, I have to recreate the posts from what I have been writing in Evernote, figure out a bit of markdown for formatting, and learn how to upload the blog to the GitHub repository to set it free.

I am so happy!! It feels great when one can get past a vexing roadblock like that: 

#### Mr. Jekyll, I warned you, you could not win    ;)

On a different note, I read an article on Medium by Benedict Neo about his [top 20][top20] machine learning and data science websites. Thank you, Benedict. 

One of those websites, [Elite Data Science][eds], has a six-week course based entirely on projects that I find very interesting. I will probably subscribe and do it when I finish one of my current courses and clear some bandwidth.
