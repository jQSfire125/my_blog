I attended a webinar by this company called [Databricks](https://databricks.com), and I have to be honest, I was a bit lost in some parts. But I made this table that helps me get an overview of machine learning frameworks:

|Machine Learning|Deep Learning |Supporting Libraries|Serving and Monitoring|
|-------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Scikit-learn|TensorFlow|Python|MLeap| 
|Spark MLlib|Keras|R|TF Serving| 
|H20|Caffe|Anaconda|Cassandra| 
|mlpack|PyTorch|Numpy|Redis| 
|Mahout|Theano|Scipy|TensorBoard| 
||BigDL|pandas||
||SparkDL|Matplotlib||
|||PyViz||

I am already starting to get comfortable with a few of them, and lists like this help me keep in mind all the things I still have to learn.

I have started reading some articles in [Medium](https://medium.com) about data science. It is a terrific publication. I like it a lot, and I have just finished reading an article on activation functions for neural networks, and they make a lot more sense to me now.

Finally, I have decided to enroll in the [Professional Certificate in Data Science][dscert] offered by HarvardX on [edX](https://www.edx.org). It is a nine-course series, and the cool thing is that it is in R, so it will complement what I have been learning in Python.

I have been researching different courses for my next steps, and I think it will help me get some formal certificates on top of the other classes I am taking. It is amazing how many quality courses by top universities are available in edX and Coursera. If you add that MIT has its whole curriculum available for free online, it is mind-blowing how accessible all this knowledge is nowadays.

One has to be thankful to be living in this information age.
