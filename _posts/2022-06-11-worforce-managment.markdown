A few months ago, I met Rey and Greg, two amazing people and incredibly skilled professionals who founded [Product Pair], a Data, Analytics, and MarTech services company in California.

They were so kind to invite me to consult on a three-month project to create a working prototype of a workforce management app for a secure communications platform.

The idea behind workforce management is to analyze past demand data, forecast the number of agents needed to meet the expected demand, and provide an interface for the group's manager to schedule the agents. The manager should be able to understand the impact of shift changes and see when they need more or fewer agents to meet the service level agreements.

It sounds a lot simpler than it is, but the team is fantastic, and I am proud to be part of this project. I will have to work hard on the weekends to do my part.

My colleague Robin, an analytics engineer, has been teaching me the ropes of dbt, docker, and how to set up my environment. He is the nicest guy and so generous. Sometimes it is overwhelming to realize how many things I don't know or understand as well as I would like. But I need to get used to this feeling and keep trying to do my best.

I am helping with some Python scripts to implement the [Erlang formula C]. This formula helps estimate how many people are needed to cover a given workload based on factors like average service time, available agents, etc. We are using a library called [pyworkforce]. Thank you, Rodrigo Arenas!

It is a bit scary to be in the standup meetings with them. What if they find out I am not as good as they think? ;)

###I am very grateful to have the opportunity to keep learning.
