Yesterday my boss delivered great news: my contract will be extended for three more months!

For me, this is a special moment. These past five weeks have been my first in a new role, in a new industry, in a new country, working in a different language and culture.

It is a lot of change, and finding out they like me enough to extend my contract is fantastic -super happy level 1 data scientist here. 

I now have the opportunity to keep learning and gaining experience with an extraordinary and friendly group of people.

While in this role, it has become clear how much it is for me to learn still. 
I am starting to research data science master's degrees online. The University of Texas at Austin offers [this program][ut]. I think I will enroll to start in the fall of 2022.
