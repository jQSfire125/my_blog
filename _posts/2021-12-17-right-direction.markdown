Yesterday my boss delivered great news: my contract will be extended for three more months!

For me, this is a special moment. These past five weeks have been my first in a new role, in a new industry, in a new country, working in a different language and culture.

It is a lot of change, and finding out they like me enough to extend my contract is fantastic -super happy level 1 data scientist here. 

I now have the opportunity to keep learning and gaining experience with an extraordinary and friendly group of people.

This new role has made evident how much more I still have to learn. 

I am starting to research data science master's degrees online. The University of Texas at Austin offers [this program][ut]. I think I might enroll to start in the fall of 2022.
