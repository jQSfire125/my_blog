Well, It turns out CS106A was **80x** oversubscribed. They expected a few hundred to a thousand people to apply, and they got over 80,000. Wow!

On the website explaining this, they are suggesting to take Harvard's [CS50][cs50] on [edX][edx] as an alternative for those of us who did not get in. 

So I joined, and I have to say that CS50 is a fantastic course. Professor Malan is a rockstar!! 

I don't know what I am missing by not getting into CS106A, but I am thrilled to be in this course. It is the starting point of my journey.

I will learn C, Python, and SQL. Then choose between building a web app, building an app in either Android or iOS, or creating a game. 

As part of the class, one has to open a GitHub account. I am now [jQSfire125][jQS].

I am just discovering this brand new world, full of really cool tools. I even picked an octocat design with my daughter for my GitHub avatar:
