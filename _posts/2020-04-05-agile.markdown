To apply, you have to solve some puzzles on a program called Karel. It was fun. I am still waiting to hear back from the people at CS106A. 

It is like Logo, a program they had us play with at a camp when I was 7. 

In the meantime, I just received my Scrum Master and Scrum Product Owner certifications from the [International Scrum Institute][isc].

#### The first step in my journey =)
