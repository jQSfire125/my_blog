Ok. So the biggest thing in the back of my mind all this time is what was the best way to master these skills in the most effiecient way and taking into account the limitations I have (full time job, family obligations, etc.)

One possibility is to take some time off and do a full-time bootcamp, or do a part-time one. 

Another path is to enroll in a Masters degree, there are plenty online that seem really good.

All this time I have been making a list of all the cool things I want to eventually learn. It is getting pretty long by now.

I just watched a video by Daniel Bourke, where he describes his personal path and how instead of spending tens of thousands of dollars in a rigid Masters that may or may not suit his needs, or even just thousands in a bootcamp, he created a list of courses and books that together form the syllabus for what he calls the Daniel Bourke [Masters Degree][danbourke].

I completely agree with him. There are just so many good courses and resources online, some free and some with a small cost, that it makes a lot more sense to assemble your own degree, especially if you are good at staying motivated and enjoy learning.

So, I have decided that this is going to be my path. I hereby present to you the:
