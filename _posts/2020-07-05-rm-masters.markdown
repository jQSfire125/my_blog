Ok. So the thing in the back of my mind is to find the best way to master these skills most efficiently considering the limitations I have (full-time job, family obligations, etc.)

One possibility is to take some time off and do a full-time Bootcamp or a part-time one. 

Another path is to enroll in a master's degree.

All this time, I have been making a list of all the cool things I want to learn eventually. It is getting pretty long.

I just watched a video by Daniel Bourke, where he describes his path. Instead of spending tens of thousands of dollars on a rigid master's degree that may not suit his interests or even thousands in a Bootcamp, he chose a different path.

He created a list of courses and books that together form the syllabus of the Daniel Bourke [Masters Degree][danbourke].

I completely agree with him. There are just so many good courses and resources online, some free and some with a small cost, that it makes a lot more sense to assemble your degree, especially if you are good at staying motivated and learning.

So, I have decided that this is going to be my path. I now present to you:
