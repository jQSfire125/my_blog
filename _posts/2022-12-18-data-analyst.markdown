After the dbt course, I signed up for a Data Modeling course at [CoRise]. For a while, it seemed that Data Modeling was a thing of the past, but it is making a comeback. It is a valuable skill, often overlooked, but still an essential part of an analyst's toolkit. 

In January, I will start officially as a data analyst. This closes the loop from when I started back in April 2020. As I said, I will be the worst analyst at [DataCamp] but part of the team nonetheless. And that is just amazing.

This 2022 has been a fantastic year. At the beginning of the year, I was so excited to have a short-term contract, looking for what I would do after it ended. Then it got extended for six months, and when that finished, for an entire year. I have learned so much. At the same time, it is wild to see that as much as I have learned, there are many more things that I still need to learn. November marked my 1st anniversary at DataCamp. Can you believe it?

The end of the year is an excellent moment to take stock of all the wonderful people I get to call my colleagues and to thank God for all the blessings. Working with such a wonderful and capable group of people is fantastic. I am forever grateful for their patience and acceptance. 

I sincerely hope to become good enough at this to stop being a burden and eventually become a productive team member.

#### I know I will get there. I have to keep at it.
