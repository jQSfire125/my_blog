I am on my third week on CS50, and it is starting to get hard. Recursion is crazy. I am beginning to think I am not as smart as I thought (and my daughter agrees).

**Hats off to all the computer scientists out there.** 

On the more accessible side, I have been doing many of Apple's Swift Playgrounds puzzles. I like how engaging they make them.

I am also starting to understand the whole wide world of programming. I heard about programming bootcamps and have been doing some research:

| School | App Academy | Hack Reactor | Fullstack | Flatiron | Lambda | Thinkful |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Programs | Software Engineering | Software Engineering | Software Engineering, Cybersecurity | Software Engineering, Data Science, Cybersecurity | Fullstack Web, Data Science, iOS Development | Software Engineering, Data Science, UX/UI, Product Management |
| Online | 24 weeks | 12 weeks | 17 weeks | 5 months | 9 months | 2 - 5 months |
| $ | 20k | 18k | 18k | 15k | 30k | 7k - 19k |
| Part-time | | 9 months | 28 weeks | 10 months | 18 months | 3 - 6 months |
| $ | | 18k | 16k | 15k | 30k | 5 - 10k |

It is extraordinary that you can spend a few months studying programming online and then getting a job as a programmer. It is also encouraging that many bootcamps offer the possibility of charging for the tuition payments once you get a job.

It seems that software engineering and full-stack web are very similar. Data Science seems very interesting:

I believe I am competitive in two of the three areas and I want to grow in the third:

* **Domain / Business Knowledge** - 20 years of business experience, strategy, and entrepreneurship.
* **Math & Statistics** - I have a strong foundation as an engineer.
* **Computer Science / IT** - Here, all I have is a deep affinity, but I'm enjoying learning.
