Great news again! When my second contract arrived a couple of weeks ago, I found out I would be renewed not for three but six more months!! Can you believe that? I am the luckiest guy.

Incredibly, I am getting paid to learn, grow as a data professional, and contribute to improving access to knowledge. One of the best things about working at [DataCamp][dc] is that the outcome we are working for is improving the data skills of our learners.

Think about scores of very bright engineers who toil daily to find more ingenious ways to nudge people to click on advertisements or collect their personal information. How is that making the world a better place? 

Not at DataCamp. If we do our job well, more people will gain more and better data science skills.

Additionally, DataCamp launched a program called [DataCamp Donates][dcd] during the pandemic. DC Donates provides scholarships to people looking for work, members of disadvantaged communities, students, and qualified research scientists.

DC Donates partners with organizations that serve those groups. I volunteered to be a mentor in the program, and I am now helping a worthy [organization][cclems] back in Mexico. I will guide them through their journey and help them get the most out of the program. I am so proud to be a part of this.

#### You can not overrate the transformative power of education.
