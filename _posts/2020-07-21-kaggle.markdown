I have started taking the courses at [Kaggle][kaggle]. It is a fantastic website. Thank you, Google, for keeping it free.

At first, I was intimidated by how fast they jumped into machine learning, building a model in the first lesson of the first course. It goes quickly, but I think it is beneficial to start getting used to the concepts, and then I can go deeper in other classes or practice in the competitions. 

I was also watching a video by [Joma Tech][joma] where he talks about the whole data science pipeline, what he calls the Data Science Hierarchy of Needs:

![Data Science Hierarchy of Needs](/my_blog/assets/images/dshierarchy.png)

It is about how the job of a data scientist/analyst/engineer can mean many different things in different companies and how there is often a disconnect between what you see in data science articles or videos and the company's requirements.

In a different video, [Krish Naik][krish] talks about his version of the data science ecosystem. It helped me get an overview, see which areas I am attacking in my learning, and what other topics/tools I will need to focus on in the future. Here is his list:

* Programming Language
    * Python
    * R
    * Java
