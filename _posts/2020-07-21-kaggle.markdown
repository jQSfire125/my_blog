I have started taking the courses at [Kaggle][kaggle]. It is an amazing website. Thank you Google for keeping it free.

At first, I was intimidated by how fast they jump into machine learning, building a model in the first lesson of the first course. It goes really fast, but I think that it is very useful to start getting used to the concepts, and then I can go deeper in other courses, or by practicing in the competitions. 

I was also watching a video by [Joma Tech][joma] where he talks about the whole data science pipeline, what he calls the Data Science Hierarchy of Needs:

It is about how the job of a data scientist / analyst / engineer can mean many different things in different companies, and how there is often times a disconnect between what is talked about in data science articles or videos, and what the requierements of a company actually are.

In a different video, [Krish Naik][krish] talks about his version of the data science ecosystem. It really helped me to get an overview, to see which areas I am attacking in my learning, and what other areas/tools I will need to focus on in the future. Here is his list:

* Programming Language
    * Python
    * R
    * Java

    * Scrapy
    * Urllib
