Today I finished the Machine Learning Scientist with Python Career track in DataCamp: 23 courses and an estimated 93 hours of instruction. It took me five months. Done!

I still don't believe I am a data scientist yet, but this was a good-sized step. I liked how scikit-learn uses a standard way of doing things, making learning a lot easier. I also enjoyed DataCamp's hands-on modules very much. They make learning so fun.

The Keras and Tensorflow modules were very cool too. The first time I saw a neural network described in [3 Blue 1 Brown][3b1b] last July, I was pretty intimidated. But after working with them in DataCamp -plus the course I took in Kaggle- I like them very much. Keras makes it easy to set up, and even at the level of these courses, there are many things one can do. 

I want to spend more time in Kaggle to learn more and join one of the neural networks competitions.

In September, I signed up for the six-week Machine Learning Accelerator with [Elite Data Science][eds]. I will start that one tomorrow. Let's see how it goes.
