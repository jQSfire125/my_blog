Today I finished the Machine Learning Scientist with Python Career track in Data Camp: 23 courses and an estimated 93 hours of instruction. It took me 5 months. Done!

I still don't believe I am a data scientist yet, but this was a good-sized step. I really liked how scikit-learn uses a standard way of doing things, which makes the learning a lot easier. I also enjoyed Data Camp's hands-on modules very much. They make learning so fun.

The Keras and Tensorflow modules were very cool too. The first time I saw a nerual network described in [3 Blue 1 Brown][3b1b] last July, I was quite intimidated. But after working with them in Data Camp -plus the course I took in Kaggle- I like them very much. Keras makes it easy to setup, and even at the level of these courses, there are a lot of things one can do. 

I want to spend more time in Kaggle to learn more and join one of the competitions that use neural networks.

Also, back in September I signed up for the 6 week Machine Learning Accelerator with [Elite Data Science][eds]. I will start that one tomorrow. Let's see how it is.
