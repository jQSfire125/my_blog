Last year I started reading a book by Nancy Pfenning on Statistics called [Elementary Statistics: looking at the big picture][book].

It is the textbook for a college introductory course on statistics. I read it because I felt I needed a refresh on statistics since the class I took in the MBA. I am happy I did.

By coincidence, both the DataCamp courses and the Harvard courses cover statistics, probability, and inference right now, so it is fantastic how the concepts from one course apply in the other and make learning much more manageable and effective.

It is also very cool to see how Python or R makes learning these concepts much better. Instead of just using mathematical formulas like the book, one can run thousands of iterations and get the approximated result. It makes understanding confidence intervals, for example, much more accessible.
