Besides the CS50 Course, I started another course in edX.

Is the first of a series of courses provided by Microsoft. It is called "Logic and Computational Thinking".

I find it a little bit too theoretical, but it has been very intersting to learn more about Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.

It is incredible to see how much western thinking (philosophy, science, politics, etc.) has been influenced by these 3 men.

How true what Socrates thought:

> I know that I know nothing

I also took two other short courses in Python on LinkedIn learning. I really enjoyed them.
