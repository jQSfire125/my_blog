Besides the CS50 Course, I started another course in edX.

It is the first of a series of courses provided by Microsoft. It is called "Logic and Computational Thinking."

I find it a little bit too theoretical, but learning more about Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle has been fascinating.

It is incredible to see how these three men have profoundly influenced western thinking (philosophy, science, politics, etc.).

How true what Socrates thought:

> I know that I know nothing

I also took two other short courses in Python on LinkedIn learning. I enjoyed them.
