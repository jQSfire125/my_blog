Today I finished the Data Scientist with Python career track in Data Camp! 23 courses and 6 projects, an estimated 88 hours of instruction. It took me 5 months.

Done, under the belt! =D

Of course, I am not yet a Data Scientist. This was just the first step, but I am noticing a lot of the syntax starts to feel familiar, and the projects that at the beginning seemed inscrutable are a lot easier, and the process makes a lot more sense. 

I am very happy I stumbled onto [Data Camp][datacamp] and I really enjoy their system. There is even an assessment tool called Data Camp Signal that measures how one stacks up against others in different skills. These are the ones I have taken so far, and my score:

|Assessment|Percentile|
|:---|:---:|
|Python Programming| 59% |
|Data Manipulation with Python| 36% |
|Importing & Cleaning Data with Python| 64% |

I am a little bit embarrassed by my score on Data Manipulation, but I will take the assessments again in a couple of months, and see how I improve...

After finishing the DS Track, I enrolled in the Machine Learning Scientist with Python Track. It is also 23 courses with 93 hours of instruction. I will try to finish it by the end of the year. I am exited because it includes scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and PySpark.
