Take a look at this beauty:

![Google Cloud Certified ACE](/my_blog/assets/images/ggcace.png)

I took the Associate Cloud Engineer certification test two days ago and passed! Google emailed me last night with the link to my [certificate][cert]. I am over the moon!

I was a bit naive going into the course, but I am glad I stuck with it to the end. It was not a tiny detour. These are some of the topics we covered in the [ACE][ace] course at [A Cloud Guru][acg]:

* Intro to the Google Cloud Platform, Products, and Services
* Google Cloud Storage
* Google Compute Engine   
* Security  
* Networking
* Google Kubernetes Engine
* Google App Engine
* Services (Databases, Machine Learning, Big Data, Operations, etc.)

I wrote about my experience in the [ACG forums][acg post]. I am not going to lie, and it was pretty hard. I watched all the videos, practiced the labs, and did the extra work. Even though I felt confident going into the test, there were many questions where I thought two of the answers could be correct, and it was hard to choose the right one.

During the ACE course, I started to get afraid this big data detour was too much and that it was taking me away from data science. However, I looked at ACG's GCP Data and Machine Learning path, and it became clear how things would tie up in the end.

These are all the courses in the [GCP Data and Machine Learning][DM path] path:

1. Novice Level
	* Intro to Cloud Computing
	* Google Cloud Concepts
	* Intro to Google Cloud
	* Linux Operating System Fundamentals
2. Apprentice Level
	* Cost Control on GCP
	* Google Cloud Essentials
3. Practitioner
	* Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners
	* Introduction to Python Development
	* Google Certified Associate Cloud Engineer
	* Google Cloud IAM Deep Dive
4. Professional
	* Intro to Machine Learning
	* Google Certified Professional Data Engineer
	* Google Cloud AI Services Deep Dive
	* Google Cloud SQL Deep Dive
5. Guru
	* Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Developer
	* Google Cloud Certified Professional Machine Learning Engineer
	
I am currently at the **Practitioner** level. I have to do two more courses before starting the **Professional** level. It will take some time, but I believe once I finish all the courses and get the certification as Machine Learning Engineer, I will be a much better Data Scientist.

For now, I will get started on the capstone projects ([EDS][eds] and [HarvardX][capstone]) that I left on hold.

#### The road is long, but the joy is in the journey...
