Well, acording to the good people at [Data Camp][dc], I can call myself a [Data Scientist][dsp]!!

Today I received my certificate. I am very happy!

The certification process has 3 parts: First, you have to pass 3 assessments. These were my scores:

|Assessment|Percentile|
|:---|:---:|
|Data Analysis in SQL (PostgreSQL) | 99% |
|Statistics Fundamentals | 98% |
|Python Programming| 99% |

You then have to solve a Python coding challenge. 

And finally, there is a case study with two sections: 

* A jupyter notebook with all the code, graphs, and modelling.
* A presentation to a non-technical stakeholder.

The case study takes place over a four-hour zoom call with a Data Camp data scientist. 

A funny fact was that since he is based in Belgium, my 9am CEST call was from 3am to 7am here in San Antonio. I had so much coffee to stay awake that Pieter, my interviewer, probably believed there was something wrong with me. ;)

I am very grateful to Data Camp for creating this certification process! It gives people like me an opportunity to prove that we can do the work.

Earning this certificate caps 16 months of work. This is a summary of the main milestones in my journey so far: 

|Month|Milestone|
|---:|:---|
|Apr 2020 | Scrum Master and Product Owner Certification |
|May 2020 | Started taking Data Camp courses |
|Aug 2020 | Started [HarvardX][harvardx] Professional Certificate in Data Science |
|Aug 2020 | Finished Python Fundamentals [Skill Track][pfst] |
|Oct 2020 | Finished Data Scientist with Python [Career Track][dsct] |
|Dec 2020| Finished [CS50][cs50] Intro to Computer Science |
|Feb 2021| Finished Machine Learning Scientist with Python [Career Track][mlsct] |
|May 2021| Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer [Certification][ace] |
|Jun 2021 | Machine Learning Accelerator [Certification][eds] |
|Jul 2021 | Earned [HarvardX][harvardx] Professional Certificate in Data Science |
|Jul 2021 | Finished SQL Fundamentals [Skill Track][sqlst] |
|May 2020 | Finished Python Programming [Skill Track][ppst] |
|May 2020 | Finished Statistics Fundamentals [Skill Track][sfst] |
|May 2020 | Earned Data Scientist Professional [Certification][dsp] |

To date, I have completed **65 courses** and earned **370,000+ XP points** in Data Camp. There is considerable overlap in some career tracks, so I can finish the Data Analyst and Python Programmer Carrer Tracks with just a few more courses. I think I will do just that soon.

I also started reading the Deep Learning with Python book by Fran√ßois Chollet. It is a great book, very clearly explained. I am only at chapter 4 and have already reached the limit of my keras knowledge. This field I chose is so amazing, so full of knowledge and innovation. I am very grateful to have the opportunity to keep learning.

I am at the very beginning of my journey... Paraphrasing Socrates: **_"the more you know, the more you realize you know nothing"_**.

### I know nothing... but I can call myself Data Scientist!!

Level 1, but Data Scientist none the less.. :)
