I am over the moon!

After a grueling and often demoralizing job hunting experience (129 applications over the last few months), I have a fantastic opportunity. 

This coming Monday will be my first day in my new job at [DataCamp][dc]. Can you believe it?

They have given me a three-month contract to help with their data science competitions. My new title is "Competitions Architect." I am in charge of researching datasets, setting up the challenges, and overall support for the data science competitions on the DataCamp platform.

DataCamp is transforming itself. They are becoming a complete data science ecosystem where you [learn][lrn], apply your knowledge with [projects][proj] and [competitions][comp], work in their hosted [environment][workspace], and get [certified][cert] to prove your skills to employers -all on the same platform.

I am super excited and grateful for this opportunity. 

To me, it is a can't lose scenario: even if my contract ends after three months, I will have learned and gained precious experience with a very respected company in the data science community. 

#### This is the first step in the professional part of my journey...
