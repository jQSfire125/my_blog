I was very fortunate to meet Greg Blackman, who invited me to join [Evello][evello] as a data science consultant. 

Evello is a revenue management platform. I will be helping design a better ranking model for the videos and creating composite metrics.

Last month I talked about my experience joining [SharpestMinds][sm] and how I was very fortunate to get [Nate Sutton][nate] as my mentor. 

Today, I am thrilled to announce I have finished my project! You can find it [here][project]. 

The project aimed to analyze prices for all hospitals in the Austin/San Antonio TX region. The first step was to go to the hospital's websites and download the pricing files they must maintain as part of their mandate.

Since every hospital uses different ways to organize the information, a big part of the project is a dockerized database that normalizes and transforms the data and then loads it into a PostgreSQL database for analysis. Once there, I assessed which hospital group was the best relative value.

It was a fantastic experience. When I first saw Nate's version of the docker container, I was very intimidated and sad. Sad that I had spent almost a year and a half training and still knew very little. I understood less than half of the code.

But the learning started there. After the initial shock, I decided to start working at the edges of what I did understand. Little by little (and much research later), I finally completed the project this last week. I am very proud and grateful to Nate for guiding me through this experience. 

#### Thank you, Nate.
