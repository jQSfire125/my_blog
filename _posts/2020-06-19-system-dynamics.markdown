Two years ago, my friend Emilio and I went to Boston to take an executive education course at MIT Sloan. After that, we decided to continue and try to complete enough courses to earn an Executive Certificate.

This week we are finishing the last one! Due to the pandemic, it was delivered online:

* [Business Dynamics][sysdyn]: MIT's Approach to Diagnosing and Solving Complex Business Problems

System Dynamics is a really interesting field with very powerful applications in business. It is based on the analysis of complex systems, which are systems where there is a delay between the actions taken and the effects of those actions. 

For example, take the pandemic: The actions our government officials take today, like closing down businesses or restricting travel, will have effect 2-3 weeks or more from now. The effects we read about in the news (cases, deaths) are the result of the conditions two to six weeks ago. So it is entirely possible that things get worse -even after restrictions have been implemented- and for some people it seems that the actions are not working, when in reality it is just the case that they have not had time to work. 

With the proper framework, one can make better decisions and many times the proper course of action is quite unintuitive.

So, with today's course Emilio and I have completed the necessary courses to receive an Executive Certificate in Technology, Operations, and Value Chain Management. Yes!

I want to especially thank Professor [John Sterman][jsmit], he is one of the best professors I have ever met. He is an inspiration and an amazing human being. Our world definitely needs more people like him. Thank you Professor Sterman.

One of my classmates in the course works in cybersecurity and I called him one day to get his opinion on my transition and education plan. He suggested starting this blog, so in the future I can share the type of problems I can solve and share my development journey. Thanks Jim.
