Yesterday I finished my final project in Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.

It was a web-based application using JavaScript, Python, Flask, and SQL. I chose to do a budgeting app where users can track their expenses based on the envelopes method. An excellent commercial application I used in the past is [Goodbudget][gb]. You can see my presentation video [here][youtube video].

I am very proud that I was able to finish on time. It is a shame the presentation video was limited to two minutes because there was a lot of functionality I could not showcase. There were moments when I thought I would have to spend most of my Christmas break working on it, but in the end, the concept started coming together very well, and I was pleased with the result.

In general, taking CS50 was a transformational experience. There were moments when I felt I was not smart enough to do some of the homework problems, but in the end, I finished them all. I have to say once we moved from C to Python, it became a lot easier. I admire those who can do complex things in C.

It turns out Professor David Malan and Brian Yu offer a companion course to CS50 called CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. 

Together, these two courses form the [Professional Certificate in Computer Science for Artificial Intelligence][aicert] from HarvardX. I want to start that second course as soon as I finish the DataCamp and HarvadX data science courses.

#### The journey continues..
