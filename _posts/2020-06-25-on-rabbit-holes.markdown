Wow, sometimes one can get deep down the rabbit hole of making a piece of software work. 

I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to install this program called [jekyll][jekyll], so I can create my blog and then upload it to my GitHub. 

The problem is that I need to catch up with other things I do not yet understand for every step in the process, which then opens another door where I need to understand that and so on.

I keep getting this error:

`You don't have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0 directory` 

Are you kidding me? Isn't this **MY** computer? If I don't have permission, **WHO** does?

Joking aside, I then went to the troubleshooting pages, and honestly, most of the commands seemed to me like incantations out of a Harry Potter book. I do not understand what I am doing. I was searching for clues in Stack Overflow, and some guy wrote:

> If you do not understand these instructions, you have NO business trying to edit your .bash_profile

So, I need to learn more about the command-line and what precisely a `PATH` is, how to edit the default place where a program is installed, what is the difference between `bin` and `usr`, and other things before I try again to wrestle control from my computer and get Jekyll installed. 

I am afraid I will accidentally break something that I do not know how to fix yet. In the meantime, I will keep these blog posts offline until I can defeat this Jekyll guy and get it to run.

#### Mr. Jekyll, you have been warned. I will win, be sure about it.
