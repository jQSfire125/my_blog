My name is Rogelio Montemayor.

I was born and raised in Mexico. I studied civil engineering at Monterrey Tech (ITESM) in Mexico, then worked for BCG, a management consulting company, and then went on to get an MBA at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Since then, I have worked in real estate, mining, and energy. 

During the MBA, I remember talking to the younger brother of a college friend who was studying computer science at Stanford. I told him that I thought what he was doing was very exciting and might give it a try. He said: "you are too old." I believed him and thought maybe in another life.

Twenty years later, I found myself rethinking that belief.

I decided that I would take advantage of the changes brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, plus some personal opportunities, and re-start my career with a deeper focus on data and analytics.

At the end of 2021, I got my first job as a data professional. I work on the data science competitions team at DataCamp, an e-learning company.

I have always loved learning, computers, and solving thought problems. I am at a stage where I want to focus more on what I want to do, what I enjoy doing, than on a title or a salary. I am very excited to be on this path.
