My name is Rogelio Montemayor

I was born and raised in Mexico. I studied civil engineering at Monterrey Tech (ITESM) in Mexico, then worked for BCG, a management consulting company, and then went on to get an MBA at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Since then I have worked in real estate, mining and energy. Until May of this year, I was the CEO of a private natural gas producer in Mexico I co-founded. It is a small company, about 60 employees.

During the MBA, I remember talking to the younger brother of a college friend who was stuyding computer science at Stanford. I told him that I thought what he was doing was very cool, that I might give it a try, and he said: “you are too old”. I believed him, thought maybe in another life.

Now, 20 years later, I find myself rethinking that belief.

I decided that I would take advantage of the changes brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, plus some personal opportunities and re-start my career with a deeper focus in data and analytics.

I have always loved learning, computers, and solving thought problems. I am at a stage in my life where I want to focus more on what I want to do, what I enjoy doing, than on a title or a salary. I am very excited to be on this path..
